Identified Threats and Risks

Proposed Remediation Strategies

Apply the Remediation Strategy: Use the recommendations to secure your database server and reduce vulnerabilities.

Risk Assessment
In this report, potential threats to the database server were identified, including external attackers, internal users, and malicious software. For each identified threat, the following were assessed:

Likelihood of occurrence (rated 1–3)

Severity of the event if it occurs (rated 1–3)

Risk (calculated by multiplying likelihood and severity)

Remediation Strategy
The following strategies are proposed to secure the system:

Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) for privileged users.

Role-based Access Control (RBAC) to limit user privileges.

Encryption using TLS instead of SSL for data transmission.

IP Allow-listing to restrict database access to corporate offices.

Regular Audits and Monitoring to detect unauthorized activities.
