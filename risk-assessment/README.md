# Risk Assessment

NIST framework implementation...This project demonstrates my ability to conduct a cybersecurity risk assessment using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework(CSF). It includes identfying threats, vulnerabilies, and implmeneting controls to mitigate the risk. 
--------
##Objective 
TO evaluate the cyber risk posture of a simulated organization and provide actionable recommendations that align with industry best practices and compliance standards. 
-------

## Methodology

The risk assessment follows these steps: 
**Asset Identification**
- Identify critical systems, data, and infastructure
- **THreat & Vulnerability Analysis**
- Masp threats and known vulnerabilities
- **Risk Evaluation**
- Use a risk matrix to rate severity (Likelihood x Impact)
- **Control Recommendations**
- Map safeguards to NIST CSF categories (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover)
- **Residual Risk Determination**
- Estimate remaining risk after mitigation
